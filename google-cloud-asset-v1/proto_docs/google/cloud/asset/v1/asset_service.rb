        #     roles, and Cloud IAM conditions. The returned Cloud IAM policies will only
        #     contain the bindings that match your query. To learn more about the IAM

        #     Examples:

        #       "Important" as a word.
        #     * `displayName:Impor*` to find Cloud resources whose display name
        #       contains "Impor" as a prefix.
        #     * `description:*por*` to find Cloud resources whose description
        #       contains "por" as a substring.
        #     * `location:us-west*` to find Cloud resources whose location is
        #       prefixed with "us-west".
        #     * `labels:prod` to find Cloud resources whose labels contain "prod" as
        #       a key or value.
        #     * `labels.env:prod` to find Cloud resources that have a label "env"
        #       and its value is "prod".
        #     * `labels.env:*` to find Cloud resources that have a label "env".
        #     * `Important` to find Cloud resources that contain "Important" as a word
        #       in any of the searchable fields.
        #     * `Impor*` to find Cloud resources that contain "Impor" as a prefix
        #       in any of the searchable fields.
        #     * `*por*` to find Cloud resources that contain "por" as a substring in
        #       any of the searchable fields.
        #     * `Important location:(us-west1 OR global)` to find Cloud
        #       resources that contain "Important" as a word in any of the searchable
        #       fields and are also located in the "us-west1" region or the "global"
        #       location.
        # @!attribute [rw] asset_types

        #     default. Returned results may be fewer than requested. When this happens,

        #       bindings that specify a role containing "storage.buckets.update"
        #       permission. Note that if callers don't have `iam.roles.get` access to a

        #       be dropped from the search results.
        #     * `resource:organizations/123456` to find IAM policy bindings
