        #
        #     The allowed values are:

        #
        #     Examples:
        #
        #     * `policy : "amy@gmail.com"` to find Cloud IAM policy bindings that
        #       specify user "amy@gmail.com".
        #     * `policy : "roles/compute.admin"` to find Cloud IAM policy bindings that
        #       specify the Compute Admin role.
        #     * `policy.role.permissions : "storage.buckets.update"` to find Cloud IAM
        #       policy bindings that specify a role containing "storage.buckets.update"
        #       permission.
        #     * `resource : "organizations/123"` to find Cloud IAM policy bindings that
        #       are set on "organizations/123".
        #     * `(resource : ("organizations/123" OR "folders/1234") AND policy : "amy")`
        #       to find Cloud IAM policy bindings that are set on "organizations/123" or
        #       "folders/1234", and also specify user "amy".

        #     appropriate default. Returned results may be fewer than requested. When
