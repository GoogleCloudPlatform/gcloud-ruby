          #
          # The `memcache.googleapis.com` service implements the Google Cloud Memorystore
          # for Memcached API and defines the following resource model for managing
          # Memorystore Memcached (also called Memcached below) instances:
          # * The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named: `/projects/*`
          # * Each project has a collection of available locations, named: `/locations/*`
          # * Each location has a collection of Memcached instances, named:
          # `/instances/*`
          # * As such, Memcached instances are resources of the form:
          #   `/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
          #
          # Note that location_id must be refering to a GCP `region`; for example:
          # * `projects/my-memcached-project/locations/us-central1/instances/my-memcached`
