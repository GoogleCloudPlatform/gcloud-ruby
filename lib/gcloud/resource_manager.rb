  #   the connection can access. See [Using OAuth 2.0 to Access Google
  #   APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2). (`String`
  #   or `Array`)
  #
  #   The default scope is:

  # # Google Cloud Resource Manager
  #
  # The Resource Manager API provides methods that you can use to
  # programmatically manage your projects in the Google Cloud Platform. You may
  # be familiar with managing projects in the [Developers
  # Console](https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/). With this API you
  # can do the following:
  #
  # * Get a list of all projects associated with an account
  # * Create new projects
  # * Update existing projects
  # * Delete projects
  # * Undelete, or recover, projects that you don't want to delete
  #
  # The Resource Manager API is a Beta release and is not covered by any SLA or
  # deprecation policy and may be subject to backward-incompatible changes.
  #
  # ## Accessing the Service
  #
  # Currently, the full functionality of the Resource Manager API is available
  # only to whitelisted users. (Contact your account manager or a member of the
  # Google Cloud sales team if you are interested in access.) Read-only methods
  # such as ResourceManager::Manager#projects and
  # ResourceManager::Manager#project are accessible to any user who enables the
  # Resource Manager API in the [Developers
  # Console](https://console.developers.google.com).
  #
  # ## Authentication
  #
  # The Resource Manager API currently requires authentication of a [User
  # Account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2), and
  # cannot currently be accessed with a [Service
  # Account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount).
  # To use a User Account install the [Google Cloud
  # SDK](http://cloud.google.com/sdk) and authenticate with the following:
  #
  # ```
  # $ gcloud auth login
  # ```
  #
  # Also make sure all `GCLOUD` environment variables are cleared of any service
  # accounts. Then gcloud will be able to detect the user authentication and
  # connect with those credentials.
  #
  # ```ruby
  # require "gcloud"
  #
  # gcloud = Gcloud.new
  # resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  # ```
  #
  # ## Listing Projects
  #
  # Project is a collection of settings, credentials, and metadata about the
  # application or applications you're working on. You can retrieve and inspect
  # all projects that you have permissions to. (See Manager#projects)
  #
  # ```ruby
  # require "gcloud"
  #
  # gcloud = Gcloud.new
  # resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  # resource_manager.projects.each do |project|
  #   puts projects.project_id
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # ## Managing Projects with Labels
  #
  # Labels can be added to or removed from projects. (See Project#labels)
  #
  # ```ruby
  # require "gcloud"
  #
  # gcloud = Gcloud.new
  # resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  # project = resource_manager.project "tokyo-rain-123"
  # # Label the project as production
  # project.update do |p|
  #   p.labels["env"] = "production"
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # Projects can then be filtered by labels. (See Manager#projects)
  #
  # ```ruby
  # require "gcloud"
  #
  # gcloud = Gcloud.new
  # resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  # # Find only the productions projects
  # projects = resource_manager.projects filter: "labels.env:production"
  # projects.each do |project|
  #   puts project.project_id
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # ## Creating a Project
  #
  # You can also use the API to create new projects. (See
  # Manager#create_project)
  #
  # ```ruby
  # require "gcloud"
  #
  # gcloud = Gcloud.new
  # resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  # project = resource_manager.create_project "tokyo-rain-123",
  #                                           name: "Todos Development",
  #                                           labels: {env: :development}
  # ```
  #
  # ## Deleting a Project
  #
  # You can delete projects when they are no longer needed. (See
  # Manager#delete and Project#delete)
  #
  # ```ruby
  # require "gcloud"
  #
  # gcloud = Gcloud.new
  # resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  # resource_manager.delete "tokyo-rain-123"
  # ```
  #
  # ## Undeleting a Project
  #
  # You can also restore a deleted project within the waiting period that
  # starts when the project was deleted. Restoring a project returns it to the
  # state it was in prior to being deleted. (See Manager#undelete and
  # Project#undelete)
  #
  # ```ruby
  # require "gcloud"
  #
  # gcloud = Gcloud.new
  # resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  # resource_manager.undelete "tokyo-rain-123"
  # ```
  #
  # ## Managing IAM Policies
  #
  # Google Cloud Identity and Access Management ([Cloud
  # IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/)) access control policies can be managed
  # on projects. These policies allow project owners to manage _who_ (identity)
  # has access to _what_ (role). See [Cloud IAM
  # Overview](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview) for more information.
  #
  # A project's access control policy can be retrieved. (See Project#policy)
  #
  # ```ruby
  # require "gcloud"
  #
  # gcloud = Gcloud.new
  # resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  # project = resource_manager.project "tokyo-rain-123"
  # policy = project.policy
  # ```
  #
  # A project's access control policy can also be set. (See Project#policy=)
  #
  # ```ruby
  # require "gcloud"
  #
  # gcloud = Gcloud.new
  # resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  # project = resource_manager.project "tokyo-rain-123"
  #
  # viewer_policy = {
  #   "bindings" => [{
  #     "role" => "roles/viewer",
  #     "members" => ["serviceAccount:your-service-account"]
  #   }]
  # }
  # project.policy = viewer_policy
  # ```
  #
  # And permissions can be tested on a project. (See Project#test_permissions)
  #
  # ```ruby
  # require "gcloud"
  #
  # gcloud = Gcloud.new
  # resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  # project = resource_manager.project "tokyo-rain-123"
  # perms = project.test_permissions "resourcemanager.projects.get",
  #                                  "resourcemanager.projects.delete"
  # perms.include? "resourcemanager.projects.get"    #=> true
  # perms.include? "resourcemanager.projects.delete" #=> false
  # ```
  #
  # For more information about using access control policies see [Managing
  # Policies](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/managing-policies).
