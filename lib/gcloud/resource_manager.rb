  # = Google Cloud Resource Manager
  #
  # The Resource Manager API provides methods that you can use to
  # programmatically manage your projects in the Google Cloud Platform. You may
  # be familiar with managing projects in the {Developers
  # Console}[https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/]. With this API you
  # can do the following:
  #
  # * Get a list of all projects associated with an account
  # * Create new projects
  # * Update existing projects
  # * Delete projects
  # * Undelete, or recover, projects that you don't want to delete
  #
  # The Resource Manager API is a Beta release and is not covered by any SLA or
  # deprecation policy and may be subject to backward-incompatible changes.
  #
  # == Accessing the Service
  #
  # The Resource Manager API *cannot* be enabled in the developer console, and
  # can only be enabled by your account manager or a member of the Google Cloud
  # sales team.
  #
  # == Authentication
  #
  # The Resource Manager API currently requires authentication of a {User
  # Account}[https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2], and
  # cannot currently be accessed with a {Service
  # Account}[https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount].
  # To use a User Account install the {Google Cloud
  # SDK}[http://cloud.google.com/sdk] and authenticate with the following:
  #
  #   $ gcloud auth login
  #
  # Also make sure all +GCLOUD+ environment variables are cleared of any service
  # accounts. Then gcloud will be able to detect the user authentication and
  # connect with those credentials.
  #
  #   require "gcloud"
  #
  #   gcloud = Gcloud.new
  #   resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  #
  # == Listing Projects
  #
  # Project is a collection of settings, credentials, and metadata about the
  # application or applications you're working on. You can retrieve and inspect
  # all projects that you have permissions to. (See Manager#projects)
  #
  #   require "gcloud"
  #
  #   gcloud = Gcloud.new
  #   resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  #   resource_manager.projects.each do |project|
  #     puts projects.project_id
  #   end
  #
  # == Managing Projects with Labels
  #
  # Labels can be added to or removed from projects. (See Project#labels)
  #
  #   require "gcloud"
  #
  #   gcloud = Gcloud.new
  #   resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  #   project = resource_manager.project "tokyo-rain-123"
  #   # Label the project as production
  #   project.update do |p|
  #     p.labels["env"] = "production"
  #   end
  #
  # Projects can then be filtered by labels. (See Manager#projects)
  #
  #   require "gcloud"
  #
  #   gcloud = Gcloud.new
  #   resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  #   # Find only the productions projects
  #   projects = resource_manager.projects filter: "labels.env:production"
  #   projects.each do |project|
  #     puts project.project_id
  #   end
  #
  # == Creating a Project
  #
  # You can also use the API to create new projects. (See
  # Manager#create_project)
  #
  #   require "gcloud"
  #
  #   gcloud = Gcloud.new
  #   resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  #   project = resource_manager.create_project "tokyo-rain-123",
  #                                             name: "Todos Development",
  #                                             labels: {env: :development}
  #
  # == Deleting a Project
  #
  # You can delete projects when they are no longer needed. (See
  # Manager#delete and Project#delete)
  #
  #   require "gcloud"
  #
  #   gcloud = Gcloud.new
  #   resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  #   resource_manager.delete "tokyo-rain-123"
  #
  # == Undeleting a Project
  #
  # You can also restore a deleted project within the waiting period that
  # starts when the project was deleted. Restoring a project returns it to the
  # state it was in prior to being deleted. (See Manager#undelete and
  # Project#undelete)
  #
  #   require "gcloud"
  #
  #   gcloud = Gcloud.new
  #   resource_manager = gcloud.resource_manager
  #   resource_manager.undelete "tokyo-rain-123"
  #
  module ResourceManager
  end
