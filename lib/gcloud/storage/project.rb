    # # Project
    #
    # Represents the project that storage buckets and files belong to.
    # All data in Google Cloud Storage belongs inside a project.
    # A project consists of a set of users, a set of APIs, billing,
    # authentication, and monitoring settings for those APIs.
    #
    # Gcloud::Storage::Project is the main object for interacting with
    # Google Storage. {Gcloud::Storage::Bucket} objects are created,
    # read, updated, and deleted by Gcloud::Storage::Project.
    #
    # See {Gcloud#storage}
    #
    # @example
    #   require "gcloud"
    #
    #   gcloud = Gcloud.new
    #   storage = gcloud.storage
    #
    #   bucket = storage.bucket "my-bucket"
