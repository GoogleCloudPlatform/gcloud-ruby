  # Backoff allows users to control how Google API calls are retried.
  # If an API call fails the response will be checked to see if the
  # call can be retried. If the response matches the criteria, then it
  # will be retried with an incremental backoff. This means that an
  # increasing delay will be added between each retried call. The first
  # retry will be delayed one second, the second retry will be delayed
  # two seconds, and so on.
