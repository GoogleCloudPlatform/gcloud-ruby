## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.4+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
in security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.4
and later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.
