    # # Google Cloud Pub/Sub
    #
    # Google Cloud Pub/Sub is designed to provide reliable, many-to-many,
    # asynchronous messaging between applications. Publisher applications can
    # send messages to a "topic" and other applications can subscribe to that
    # topic to receive the messages. By decoupling senders and receivers, Google
    # Cloud Pub/Sub allows developers to communicate between independently
    # written applications.
    #
    # The goal of google-cloud is to provide an API that is comfortable to
    # Rubyists. Your authentication credentials are detected automatically in
    # Google Cloud Platform environments such as Google Compute Engine, Google
    # App Engine and Google Kubernetes Engine. In other environments you can
    # configure authentication easily, either directly in your code or via
    # environment variables. Read more about the options for connecting in the
    # [Authentication
    # Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/guides/authentication).
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # topic = pubsub.topic "my-topic"
    # topic.publish "task completed"
    # ```
    #
    # To learn more about Pub/Sub, read the [Google Cloud Pub/Sub Overview
    # ](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/overview).
    #
    # ## Enabling Logging
    #
    # To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying
    # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library. The
    # logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib
    # [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html)
    # as shown below, or a
    # [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-logging/latest/google/cloud/logging/logger)
    # that will write logs to [Stackdriver
    # Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See
    # [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
    # and the gRPC
    # [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb)
    # for additional information.
    #
    # Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "logger"
    #
    # module MyLogger
    #   LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
    #   def logger
    #     LOGGER
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # # Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
    # module GRPC
    #   extend MyLogger
    # end
    # ```
    #
    # ## Retrieving Topics
    #
    # A Topic is a named resource to which messages are sent by publishers.
    # A Topic is found by its name. (See {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Project#topic})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    # topic = pubsub.topic "my-topic"
    # ```
    #
    # ## Creating a Topic
    #
    # A Topic is created from a Project. (See
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Project#create_topic})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    # topic = pubsub.create_topic "my-topic"
    # ```
    #
    # ## Retrieving Subscriptions
    #
    # A Subscription is a named resource representing the stream of messages
    # from a single, specific Topic, to be delivered to the subscribing
    # application. A Subscription is found by its name. (See
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Topic#subscription})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # topic = pubsub.topic "my-topic"
    # subscription = topic.subscription "my-topic-subscription"
    # puts subscription.name
    # ```
    #
    # ## Creating a Subscription
    #
    # A Subscription is created from a Topic. (See
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Topic#subscribe} and
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Project#subscribe})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # topic = pubsub.topic "my-topic"
    # sub = topic.subscribe "my-topic-sub"
    # puts sub.name # => "my-topic-sub"
    # ```
    #
    # The subscription can be created that specifies the number of seconds to
    # wait to be acknowledged as well as an endpoint URL to push the messages
    # to:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # topic = pubsub.topic "my-topic"
    # sub = topic.subscribe "my-topic-sub",
    #                       deadline: 120,
    #                       endpoint: "https://example.com/push"
    # ```
    #
    # ## Publishing Messages
    #
    # Messages are published to a topic. Any message published to a topic
    # without a subscription will be lost. Ensure the topic has a subscription
    # before publishing. (See {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Topic#publish} and
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Project#publish})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # topic = pubsub.topic "my-topic"
    # msg = topic.publish "task completed"
    # ```
    #
    # Messages can also be published with attributes:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # topic = pubsub.topic "my-topic"
    # msg = topic.publish "task completed",
    #                     foo: :bar,
    #                     this: :that
    # ```
    #
    # Messages can also be published in batches asynchronously using
    # `publish_async`. (See {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Topic#publish_async} and
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::AsyncPublisher})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # topic = pubsub.topic "my-topic"
    # topic.publish_async "task completed" do |result|
    #   if result.succeeded?
    #     log_publish_success result.data
    #   else
    #     log_publish_failure result.data, result.error
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # topic.async_publisher.stop.wait!
    # ```
    #
    # Or multiple messages can be published in batches at the same time by
    # passing a block to `publish`. (See
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::BatchPublisher})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # topic = pubsub.topic "my-topic"
    # msgs = topic.publish do |batch|
    #   batch.publish "task 1 completed", foo: :bar
    #   batch.publish "task 2 completed", foo: :baz
    #   batch.publish "task 3 completed", foo: :bif
    # end
    # ```
    #
    # ## Receiving messages
    #
    # Messages can be streamed from a subscription with a subscriber object
    # that is created using `listen`. (See
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Subscription#listen} and
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Subscriber})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # sub = pubsub.subscription "my-topic-sub"
    #
    # subscriber = sub.listen do |received_message|
    #   # process message
    #   received_message.acknowledge!
    # end
    #
    # # Start background threads that will call the block passed to listen.
    # subscriber.start
    #
    # # Shut down the subscriber when ready to stop receiving messages.
    # subscriber.stop.wait!
    # ```
    #
    # Messages also can be pulled directly in a one-time operation. (See
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Subscription#pull})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # sub = pubsub.subscription "my-topic-sub"
    # received_messages = sub.pull
    # ```
    #
    # A maximum number of messages to pull can be specified:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # sub = pubsub.subscription "my-topic-sub"
    # received_messages = sub.pull max: 10
    # ```
    #
    # ## Acknowledging a Message
    #
    # Messages that are received can be acknowledged in Pub/Sub, marking the
    # message to be removed so it cannot be pulled again.
    #
    # A Message that can be acknowledged is called a ReceivedMessage.
    # ReceivedMessages can be acknowledged one at a time:
    # (See {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::ReceivedMessage#acknowledge!})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # sub = pubsub.subscription "my-topic-sub"
    #
    # subscriber = sub.listen do |received_message|
    #   # process message
    #   received_message.acknowledge!
    # end
    #
    # # Start background threads that will call the block passed to listen.
    # subscriber.start
    #
    # # Shut down the subscriber when ready to stop receiving messages.
    # subscriber.stop.wait!
    # ```
    #
    # Or, multiple messages can be acknowledged in a single API call:
    # (See {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Subscription#acknowledge})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # sub = pubsub.subscription "my-topic-sub"
    # received_messages = sub.pull
    # sub.acknowledge received_messages
    # ```
    #
    # ## Modifying a Deadline
    #
    # A message must be acknowledged after it is pulled, or Pub/Sub will mark
    # the message for redelivery. The message acknowledgement deadline can
    # delayed if more time is needed. This will allow more time to process the
    # message before the message is marked for redelivery. (See
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::ReceivedMessage#delay!})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # sub = pubsub.subscription "my-topic-sub"
    # subscriber = sub.listen do |received_message|
    #   puts received_message.message.data
    #
    #   # Delay for 2 minutes
    #   received_message.delay! 120
    # end
    #
    # # Start background threads that will call the block passed to listen.
    # subscriber.start
    #
    # # Shut down the subscriber when ready to stop receiving messages.
    # subscriber.stop.wait!
    # ```
    #
    # The message can also be made available for immediate redelivery:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # sub = pubsub.subscription "my-topic-sub"
    # subscriber = sub.listen do |received_message|
    #   puts received_message.message.data
    #
    #   # Mark for redelivery
    #   received_message.reject!
    # end
    #
    # # Start background threads that will call the block passed to listen.
    # subscriber.start
    #
    # # Shut down the subscriber when ready to stop receiving messages.
    # subscriber.stop.wait!
    # ```
    #
    # Multiple messages can be delayed or made available for immediate
    # redelivery: (See {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Subscription#delay})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # sub = pubsub.subscription "my-topic-sub"
    # received_messages = sub.pull
    # sub.delay 120, received_messages
    # ```
    #
    # ## Creating a snapshot and using seek
    #
    # You can create a snapshot to retain the existing backlog on a
    # subscription. The snapshot will hold the messages in the subscription's
    # backlog that are unacknowledged upon the successful completion of the
    # `create_snapshot` operation.
    #
    # Later, you can use `seek` to reset the subscription's backlog to the
    # snapshot.
    #
    # (See {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Subscription#create_snapshot} and
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Subscription#seek})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # sub = pubsub.subscription "my-topic-sub"
    #
    # snapshot = sub.create_snapshot
    #
    # received_messages = sub.pull
    # sub.acknowledge received_messages
    #
    # sub.seek snapshot
    # ```
    #
    # ## Listening for Messages
    #
    # A subscriber object can be created using `listen`, which streams messages
    # from the backend and processes them as they are received. (See
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Subscription#listen} and
    # {Google::Cloud::Pubsub::Subscriber})
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # sub = pubsub.subscription "my-topic-sub"
    #
    # subscriber = sub.listen do |received_message|
    #   # process message
    #   received_message.acknowledge!
    # end
    #
    # # Start background threads that will call the block passed to listen.
    # subscriber.start
    #
    # # Shut down the subscriber when ready to stop receiving messages.
    # subscriber.stop.wait!
    # ```
    #
    # The subscriber object can be configured to control the number of
    # concurrent streams to open, the number of received messages to be
    # collected, and the number of threads each stream opens for concurrent
    # calls made to handle the received messages.
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new
    #
    # sub = pubsub.subscription "my-topic-sub"
    #
    # subscriber = sub.listen threads: { callback: 16 } do |received_message|
    #   # store the message somewhere before acknowledging
    #   store_in_backend received_message.data # takes a few seconds
    #   received_message.acknowledge!
    # end
    #
    # # Start background threads that will call the block passed to listen.
    # subscriber.start
    # ```
    #
    # ## Working Across Projects
    #
    # All calls to the Pub/Sub service use the same project and credentials
    # provided to the {Google::Cloud#pubsub} method. However, it is common to
    # reference topics or subscriptions in other projects, which can be achieved
    # by using the `project` option. The main credentials must have permissions
    # to the topics and subscriptions in other projects.
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new # my-project
    #
    # # Get a topic in the current project
    # my_topic = pubsub.topic "my-topic"
    # my_topic.name #=> "projects/my-project/topics/my-topic"
    # # Get a topic in another project
    # other_topic = pubsub.topic "other-topic", project: "other-project-id"
    # other_topic.name #=> "projects/other-project-id/topics/other-topic"
    # ```
    #
    # It is possible to create a subscription in the current project that pulls
    # from a topic in another project:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new # my-project
    #
    # # Get a topic in another project
    # topic = pubsub.topic "other-topic", project: "other-project-id"
    # # Create a subscription in the current project that pulls from
    # # the topic in another project
    # sub = topic.subscribe "my-sub"
    # sub.name #=> "projects/my-project/subscriptions/my-sub"
    # sub.topic.name #=> "projects/other-project-id/topics/other-topic"
    # ```
    #
    # ## Using the Google Cloud Pub/Sub Emulator
    #
    # To develop and test your application locally, you can use the [Google
    # Cloud Pub/Sub Emulator](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/emulator), which
    # provides [local
    # emulation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/emulators/)
    # of the production Google Cloud Pub/Sub environment. You can start the
    # Google Cloud Pub/Sub emulator using the `gcloud` command-line tool.
    #
    # To configure your ruby code to use the emulator, set the
    # `PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable to the host and port where the
    # emulator is running. The value can be set as an environment variable in
    # the shell running the ruby code, or can be set directly in the ruby code
    # as shown below.
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "google/cloud/pubsub"
    #
    # # Make Pub/Sub use the emulator
    # ENV["PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST"] = "localhost:8918"
    #
    # pubsub = Google::Cloud::Pubsub.new "emulator-project-id"
    #
    # # Get a topic in the current project
    # my_topic = pubsub.new_topic "my-topic"
    # my_topic.name #=> "projects/emulator-project-id/topics/my-topic"
    # ```
    #
    module Pubsub
      ##
      # Creates a new object for connecting to the Pub/Sub service.
