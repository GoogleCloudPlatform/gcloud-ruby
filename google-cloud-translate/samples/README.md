# Google Cloud Translation API Ruby Samples

The [Google Cloud Translation API][translate_docs] can dynamically translate
text between thousands of language pairs. The Cloud Translation API lets
websites and programs integrate with the translation service programmatically.

## Setup

### Authentication

Authentication is typically done through [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#getting_credentials_for_server-centric_flow)
, which means you do not have to change the code to authenticate as long as your
environment has credentials. You have a few options for setting up
authentication:

1.  When running locally, use the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/)

        gcloud auth application-default login

1.  When running on App Engine or Compute Engine, credentials are already set-up.
    However, you may need to configure your Compute Engine instance with
    [additional scopes](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/authentication#using).

1.  You can create a [Service Account key file](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#service_accounts).
    This file can be used to authenticate to Google Cloud Platform services from
    any environment. To use the file, set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
    environment variable to the path to the key file, for example:

        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account.json

### Set Project ID

Next, set the *GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT* environment variable to the project name
set in the
[Google Cloud Platform Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com):

    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR-PROJECT-ID"

### Install Dependencies

1.  Install the [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) gem.

2.  Decide whether to run against the current code in git, or the latest gem
    release. To run against the current git code:

        export GOOGLE_CLOUD_SAMPLES_TEST=master

    To run against the latest gem release, unset that variable.

3.  Install dependencies using:

        bundle install

### Install fixtures

Some samples require a test fixture to be installed in your project
(specifically, a glossary that is used for testing get and list commands).
To install this fixture:

    bundle exec rake fixtures:create

This is a task that needs to be run only once per project.

## Testing samples

    bundle exec rake test
