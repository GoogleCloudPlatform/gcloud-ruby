      The 3.0 release of the google-cloud-translate client is a significant upgrade
      based on a [next-gen code generator](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-ruby),
      and includes substantial interface changes. Existing code written for earlier
      versions of this library will likely require updates to use this version.

      This library is supported on Ruby 2.5+.
      Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
      by Ruby Coreâ€”that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or
      in security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.5
      and later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
      recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
      about the Ruby support schedule.
