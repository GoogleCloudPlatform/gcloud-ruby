      # # Ruby Client for Cloud AutoML API
      #
      # [Cloud AutoML API][Product Documentation]:
      # Train high-quality custom machine learning models with minimum effort and
      # machine learning expertise.
      # - [Product Documentation][]
      #
      # ## Quick Start
      # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
      # steps:
      #
      # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
      # 2. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
      # 3. [Enable the Cloud AutoML API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/automl.googleapis.com)
      # 4. [Setup Authentication.](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-automl/latest/file.AUTHENTICATION.html)
      #
      # ### Installation
      # ```
      # $ gem install google-cloud-automl
      # ```
      #
      # ### Next Steps
      # - Read the [Cloud AutoML API Product documentation][Product Documentation]
      #   to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
      # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md)
      #   to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.

      # ## Enabling Logging
      #
      # To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library.
      # The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below,
      # or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-cloud-logging/latest)
      # that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
      # and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.
      #
      # Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:
      #
      # ```ruby
      # require "logger"
      #
      # module MyLogger
      #   LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
      #   def logger
      #     LOGGER
      #   end
      # end
      #
      # # Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
      # module GRPC
      #   extend MyLogger
      # end
      # ```

          #
          # The resource names are assigned by the server.
          # The server never reuses names that it has created after the resources with
          # those names are deleted.
          #
          # An ID of a resource is the last element of the item's resource name. For
          # `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}`, then
          # the id for the item is `{dataset_id}`.
          #
          # Currently the only supported `location_id` is "us-central1".
