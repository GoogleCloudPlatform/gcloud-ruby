        #     Codec](http://flac.sourceforge.net/documentation.html) encoding.
        #     Only 16-bit samples are supported. Not all fields in STREAMINFO
        #     are supported. (FLAC)
        #   * `mulaw` - 8-bit samples that compand 14-bit audio samples using
        #     G.711 PCMU/mu-law. (MULAW)
        #   * `amr` - Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrowband codec. (`sample_rate` must
        #     be 8000 Hz.) (AMR)
        #   * `amr_wb` - Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband codec. (`sample_rate` must
        #     be 16000 Hz.) (AMR_WB)
        #   * `ogg_opus` - Ogg Mapping for Opus. (OGG_OPUS)
        #
        #     Lossy codecs do not recommend, as they result in a lower-quality
        #     speech transcription.
        #   * `speex` - Speex with header byte. (SPEEX_WITH_HEADER_BYTE)
        #
        #     Lossy codecs do not recommend, as they result in a lower-quality
        #     speech transcription. If you must use a low-bitrate encoder,
