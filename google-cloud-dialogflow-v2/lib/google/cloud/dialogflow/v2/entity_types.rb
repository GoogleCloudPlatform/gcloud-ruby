        # Entities are extracted from user input and represent parameters that are
        # meaningful to your application. For example, a date range, a proper name
        # such as a geographic location or landmark, and so on. Entities represent
        # actionable data for your application.
        #
        # When you define an entity, you can also include synonyms that all map to
        # that entity. For example, "soft drink", "soda", "pop", and so on.
        #
        # There are three types of entities:
        #
        # *   **System** - entities that are defined by the Dialogflow API for common
        #     data types such as date, time, currency, and so on. A system entity is
        #     represented by the `EntityType` type.
        #
        # *   **Custom** - entities that are defined by you that represent
        #     actionable data that is meaningful to your application. For example,
        #     you could define a `pizza.sauce` entity for red or white pizza sauce,
        #     a `pizza.cheese` entity for the different types of cheese on a pizza,
        #     a `pizza.topping` entity for different toppings, and so on. A custom
        #     entity is represented by the `EntityType` type.
        #
        # *   **User** - entities that are built for an individual user such as
        #     favorites, preferences, playlists, and so on. A user entity is
        #     represented by the {::Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2::SessionEntityType SessionEntityType} type.
        #
        # For more information about entity types, see the
        # [Dialogflow
        # documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).
