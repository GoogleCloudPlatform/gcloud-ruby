        ##
        # A context represents additional information included with user input or with
        # an intent returned by the Dialogflow API. Contexts are helpful for
        # differentiating user input which may be vague or have a different meaning
        # depending on additional details from your application such as user setting
        # and preferences, previous user input, where the user is in your application,
        # geographic location, and so on.
        #
        # You can include contexts as input parameters of a
        # {::Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2::Sessions::Client#detect_intent DetectIntent} (or
        # {::Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2::Sessions::Client#streaming_detect_intent StreamingDetectIntent}) request,
        # or as output contexts included in the returned intent.
        # Contexts expire when an intent is matched, after the number of `DetectIntent`
        # requests specified by the `lifespan_count` parameter, or after 20 minutes
        # if no intents are matched for a `DetectIntent` request.
        #
        # For more information about contexts, see the
        # [Dialogflow
        # documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
