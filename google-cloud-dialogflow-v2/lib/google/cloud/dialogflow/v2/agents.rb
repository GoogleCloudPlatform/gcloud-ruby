        ##
        # Agents are best described as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modules
        # that transform user requests into actionable data. You can include agents
        # in your app, product, or service to determine user intent and respond to the
        # user in a natural way.
        #
        # After you create an agent, you can add {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2::Intents::Client Intents}, {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2::Contexts::Client Contexts},
        # [Entity Types][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.EntityTypes], {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2::WebhookRequest Webhooks}, and so on to
        # manage the flow of a conversation and match user input to predefined intents
        # and actions.
        #
        # You can create an agent using both Dialogflow Standard Edition and
        # Dialogflow Enterprise Edition. For details, see
        # [Dialogflow
        # Editions](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/editions).
        #
        # You can save your agent for backup or versioning by exporting the agent by
        # using the {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2::Agents::Client#export_agent ExportAgent} method. You can import a saved
        # agent by using the {Google::Cloud::Dialogflow::V2::Agents::Client#import_agent ImportAgent} method.
        #
        # Dialogflow provides several
        # [prebuilt
        # agents](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/agents-prebuilt)
        # for common conversation scenarios such as determining a date and time,
        # converting currency, and so on.
        #
        # For more information about agents, see the
        # [Dialogflow
        # documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/agents-overview).
