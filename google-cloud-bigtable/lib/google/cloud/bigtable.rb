    # # Ruby Client for Cloud Bigtable API ([Alpha](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby#versioning))
    #
    # [Cloud Bigtable API][Product Documentation]:
    # API for reading and writing the contents of Bigtables associated with a
    # cloud project.
    # - [Product Documentation][]
    #
    # ## Quick Start
    # In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following
    # steps:
    #
    # 1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
    # 2. [Enable billing for your project.](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
    # 3. [Enable the Cloud Bigtable API.](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/bigtable)
    # 4. [Setup Authentication.](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud/master/guides/authentication)
    #
    # ### Next Steps
    # - Read the [Cloud Bigtable API Product documentation][Product Documentation]
    #   to learn more about the product and see How-to Guides.
    # - View this [repository's main README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-ruby/blob/master/README.md)
    #   to see the full list of Cloud APIs that we cover.
    #
    # ## Enabling Logging
    #
    # To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying
    # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library. The
    # logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib
    # [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html)
    # as shown below, or a
    # [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-logging/latest/google/cloud/logging/logger)
    # that will write logs to [Stackdriver
    # Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See
    # [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
    # and the gRPC
    # [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb)
    # for additional information.
    #
    # Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "logger"
    #
    # module MyLogger
    #   LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
    #   def logger
    #     LOGGER
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # # Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
    # module GRPC
    #   extend MyLogger
    # end
    # ```

    module Bigtable

      # Service for managing bigtable instance, tables and reading from and writing to existing Bigtable tables.
      #
      # @param project_id [String]
      #   Project identifier for bigtable
      # @param client_type [Symbol]
      #   Client type are
      #   `:data` - data operartions(read rows, update cells etc)
      #   `:table` - table admin operartions(create, delete, update, list etc)
      #   `:instance` - instance admin operartions(create, delete, update, list etc)
      #   Default client type is `:data`.
      # @param instance_id [String]
      #   Bigtable instance identifier
      # @param credentials [Google::Auth::Credentials, String, Hash, GRPC::Core::Channel, GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials, Proc]
      #   Provides the means for authenticating requests made by the client. This parameter can
      #   be many types.
      #   A `Google::Auth::Credentials` uses a the properties of its represented keyfile for
      #   authenticating requests made by this client.
      #   A `String` will be treated as the path to the keyfile to be used for the construction of
      #   credentials for this client.
      #   A `Hash` will be treated as the contents of a keyfile to be used for the construction of
      #   credentials for this client.
      #   A `GRPC::Core::Channel` will be used to make calls through.
      #   A `GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials` for the setting up the RPC client. The channel credentials
      #   should already be composed with a `GRPC::Core::CallCredentials` object.
      #   A `Proc` will be used as an updater_proc for the Grpc channel. The proc transforms the
      #   metadata for requests, generally, to give OAuth credentials.
      # @param scopes [Array<String>]
      #   The OAuth scopes for this service. This parameter is ignored if an
      #   updater_proc is supplied.
      # @param client_config [Hash]
      #   A Hash for call options for each method.
      #   See Google::Gax#construct_settings for the structure of
      #   this data. Falls back to the default config if not specified
      #   or the specified config is missing data points.
      # @param timeout [Integer]
      #   The default timeout, in seconds, for calls made through this client.
      # @return [Google::Cloud::InstanceAdminClient | Google::Cloud::TableAdminClient | Google::Cloud::DataClient]
