# google-cloud-logging

[Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/) ([docs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/)) allows you to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on log data and events from Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services (AWS). It supports ingestion of any custom log data from any source. Stackdriver Logging is a fully-managed service that performs at scale and can ingest application and system log data from thousands of VMs. Even better, you can analyze all that log data in real-time.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ gem install google-cloud-logging
```

## Authentication

This library uses Service Account credentials to connect to Google Cloud services. When running on Compute Engine the credentials will be discovered automatically. When running on other environments the Service Account credentials can be specified by providing the path to the JSON file, or the JSON itself, in environment variables.

Instructions and configuration options are covered in the [Authentication Guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-logging/guides/authentication).

## Example

```ruby
require "google/cloud/logging"

logging = Google::Cloud.new.logging

# List all log entries
logging.entries.each do |e|
  puts "[#{e.timestamp}] #{e.log_name} #{e.payload.inspect}"
end

# List only entries from a single log
entries = logging.entries filter: "log:syslog"

# Write a log entry
entry = logging.entry
entry.payload = "Job started."
entry.log_name = "my_app_log"
entry.resource.type = "gae_app"
entry.resource.labels[:module_id] = "1"
entry.resource.labels[:version_id] = "20150925t173233"

logging.write_entries entry
```
