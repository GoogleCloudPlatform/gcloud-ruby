      # # AsyncWriter
      #
      # An object that batches and transmits log entries asynchronously.
      #
      # Use this object to transmit log entries efficiently. It keeps a queue
      # of log entries, and runs a background thread that transmits them to
      # the logging service in batches. Generally, adding to the queue will
      # not block.
      #
      # This object is thread-safe; it may accept write requests from
      # multiple threads simultaneously, and will serialize them when
      # executing in the background thread.
      #
      # @example
      #   require "google/cloud"
      #
      #   gcloud = Google::Cloud.new
      #   logging = gcloud.logging

      #   entry2 = logging.entry payload: "Job completed."
      #
      #   labels = { job_size: "large", job_code: "red" }
      #   resource = logging.resource "gae_app",
      #                               "module_id" => "1",
