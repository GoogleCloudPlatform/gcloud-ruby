      # information about billing and authorized users, and they control access
      # to Stackdriver Logging resources. Each project has a friendly name and a
      # unique ID. Projects can be created only in the [Google Developers
      # Console](https://console.developers.google.com). See
      # {Google::Cloud#logging}.

      # @example
